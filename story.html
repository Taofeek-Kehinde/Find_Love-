    <h1>Sophie & Marcus</h1>

    <p>
      Sophie and Marcus were matched by our algorithm despite living on different continents. 
      Their first conversation lasted until sunrise, and they knew they had found something special.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "We spent six months video chatting every day. When Marcus finally visited Paris, 
      he proposed at the Eiffel Tower. We now split our time between Paris and New York, 
      embracing the best of both worlds."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In the beginning, it was not easy. Time zones meant that Sophie was often just waking up 
      when Marcus was heading to bed. But instead of letting this distance divide them, 
      they found joy in the routine — Sophie would sip her morning coffee while Marcus 
      enjoyed a late-night snack, and together they created moments that felt timeless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their conversations quickly grew deeper. They spoke of childhood memories, 
      dreams for the future, and the challenges they had overcome. By the third week, 
      they both admitted they were waiting all day just to hear the other’s voice. 
      What began as curiosity had blossomed into something they couldn’t ignore.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "It felt like we had known each other forever, even though we had never met in person," 
      Sophie recalls. "Marcus had a way of making the distance disappear."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      After months of long-distance connection, Marcus booked his first flight to Paris. 
      Sophie waited nervously at Charles de Gaulle Airport, her heart racing as the arrivals 
      board flashed his flight as “Landed.” When their eyes finally met, it was as if the world 
      stood still. The hug that followed erased every mile that had ever separated them.
    </p>

    <p>
      They spent that week walking the romantic streets of Paris, 
      laughing in small cafés, and sharing their favorite spots in the city. 
      But the most unforgettable moment came one evening at the Eiffel Tower, 
      where Marcus got down on one knee and asked Sophie to be his forever. 
      Tears filled her eyes as she said yes, surrounded by glittering lights.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "That night at the Eiffel Tower was everything I had ever dreamed of," 
      Sophie says. "It wasn’t just about the proposal — it was about every call, 
      every laugh, and every moment that led us there."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Today, Sophie and Marcus split their time between Paris and New York. 
      They’ve built a life that blends their worlds together — mornings at a Parisian bakery, 
      evenings in Central Park, and adventures that take them across oceans. 
      Their story is a testament that love knows no borders, and that sometimes, 
      the person you’re meant to be with is waiting just a click away.
